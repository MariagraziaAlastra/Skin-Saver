Skin-Saver
==========

This is my first web-app for Firefox OS, Firefox for Android and Firefox for desktop. It's a porting of Skin Saver for Android, which you can find on Google Play and which is also developed by me. The app simply has a list of ingredients (with their inci-name and a short description) to avoid in cosmetics such as moisturizers, shampoos, hair conditioner, soaps, etc for various reasons. I've listed the ones I usually avoid (silicone, petrolatum and so on), but everyone is free to add, remove and/or modify the list, for example if some particular ingredient gives him/her allergy or whatsoever. Why this list? Because people usually don't know the inci name of cosmetic ingredients, or if they do, the names are difficult to remember, so it's useful to have a handy, viewable offline, list for reference while shopping.
