What is Skin Saver?
-------------------

Skin Saver is your best friend when it comes to purchasing cosmetics!

Did you ever try to read the [INCI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Nomenclature_of_Cosmetic_Ingredients) (list of ingredients) of a shampoo, moisturizer, soap or toothpaste before buying it?
No? Well, that's not surprising: nearly nobody, in fact, does it, because they can't understand the INCI names of the ingredients.
In fact, who would suspect that, for instance, "Sodium Lauryl Sulfate" is a surfactant (and a very aggresive one, too), or in other words the thing that actually washes you when you use that particular shampoo?
But, if you don't know how to read an INCI, how can you expect to judge if a product is worthy of your money?
Maybe you are allergic to a particular ingredient. Maybe that product is too aggressive for you, even if on the package it says "delicate".
Maybe you expect that hair/face/body treatment to be a miracle in a jar and you're going to spend a lot of money for something that doesn't fit your skin, or
doesn't fit anybody's skin, eventually.

So, I heartily suggest you to do some research about this subject, to inform yourself (and maybe search for the INCI name of the ingredients you know you're allergic to).
Next, you could find that the names of the ingredients you should avoid are a little difficult to remember, and there's where Skin Saver comes in handy, with a predefined list counting more than
30 INCI names of ingredients to avoid, with editable descriptions; you can also add or remove ingredients, or reset the list.
